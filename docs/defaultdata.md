## Instructions on how to import Default data
To import this default data you need to have Postman installed on your computer. <br/>
Postman is a free and powerful application for Mac, Windows and Linux that lets a user do HTTP-requests directly from your computer. <br/>
In addition to make HTTP requests the user can also make environments and save global settings and variables to be reused in later request. 
That is what we have done for adding default data in this exam.

[Get Postman here](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)
